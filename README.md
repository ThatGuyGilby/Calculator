# Calculator

This project demonstrates the development and testing of a Calculator application using Java AWT. I was motivated to create this project to further my understanding of the JUnit testing features as well as refreshing my Java abilities.

This project handles many common issues that are common in most starter calculator applications such as dividing by zero. This was accomplished by using a robust suite of tests for each possible use case.
